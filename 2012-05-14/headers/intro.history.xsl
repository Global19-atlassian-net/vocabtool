<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p/>This document is an authoritative specification of
all metadata terms maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata
Initiative in all of their historical versions.

<p/>Most users will not need the historical detail presented
here and should instead consult the document "DCMI Metadata
Terms", which presents only the most current information on
terms [<a href="#A1">TERMS</a>].  In addition to the attributes 
used to describe terms in "DCMI Metadata Terms" [<a href="#A1">TERMS</a>], 
this document includes additional information related to the versioning
history of individual terms:
